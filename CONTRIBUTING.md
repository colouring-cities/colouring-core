## Branch naming

Branch names should indicate type of work. For fixes also related issue should be mentioned.

The format is `fix/123-short-description`, `feature/description` or `feature/123-short-description`.


For example
* [PR 648](https://github.com/colouring-london/colouring-london/pull/684) used branch `fix/681-land-use-edit` referencing [#681](https://github.com/colouring-london/colouring-london/issues/681)
* [PR 625](https://github.com/colouring-london/colouring-london/pull/625) used branch `feature/verification`

## Commits

Commit messages should start from an upper case. So `Change public ownership sources field to array` is preferred over `change public ownership sources field to array`.
