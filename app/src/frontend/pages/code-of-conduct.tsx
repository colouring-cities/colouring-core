        <h2 className="h3">Our Pledge</h2>

        <p>
        In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
        contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
        our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
        size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
        level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
        appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
        </p>
        <h2 className="h3">Our Standards</h2>
        <p>
        Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment
        include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
            <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
            <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
            <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
            <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or</li>
            advances
            <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
            <li>Public or private harassment</li>
            <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
            <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="h3">Our Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
        Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
        behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
        response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
        Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
        reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
        that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
        permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
        threatening, offensive, or harmful.
        </p>

        <h2 className="h3">Scope</h2>
        <p>
        This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
        an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
        Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
        project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
        as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
        a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="h3">Enforcement</h2>
        <p>
        Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by
        contacting the project team at <a
        href="mailto:team@colouring.london">team@colouring.london</a> or <a
        href="dataprotection@turing.ac.uk">dataprotection@turing.ac.uk</a>. All complaints will
        be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
        appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
        confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
        specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
        </p>

        <p>
        Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
        faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
        members of the project's leadership.
        </p>
