            </p>

            <h2 className='h2'>What are your data protection rights?</h2>
            <p>
                Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have certain individual rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. For the purposes of research where such individual rights would seriously impair research outcomes, such rights are limited. However, subject to certain conditions, you have the following rights in relation to your personal data:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A right to access personal data held by us about you.
                </ li>

                <li>
                    A right to require us to rectify any inaccurate personal data held by us about you.
                </ li>

                <li>
                    A right to require us to erase personal data held by us about you. This right will only apply where, for example, we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for.
                </ li>

                <li>
                    A right to restrict our processing of personal data held by us about you. This right will only apply where, for example, you dispute the accuracy of the personal data held by us; or where you would have the right to require us to erase the personal data but would prefer that our processing is restricted instead; or where we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for, but we require the data for the purposes of dealing with legal claims.
                </ li>

                <li>
                    A right to receive personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to require us to transfer this personal data to another organisation.
                </ li>

                <li>
                    A right to object to our processing of personal data held by us about you.
                </ li>

                <li>
                    A right to withdraw your consent, where we are relying on it to use your personal data.
                </ li>

                <li>
                    A right to ask us not to use information about you in a way that allows computers to make decisions about you and ask us to stop.
                </ li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                It is important to understand that the extent to which these rights apply to research will vary and that in some circumstances your rights may be restricted. If you notify us (using the contact details set out below) that you wish to exercise any of the above rights and it is considered necessary to refuse to comply with any of your individual rights, you will be informed of the decision within one month and you also have the right to complain about our decision to the Information Commissioner’s Office.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please also note that we can only comply with a request to exercise your rights during the period for which we hold personal information about you. If that information has been irreversibly anonymised and has become part of the research data set, it will no longer be possible for us to access your personal information.
            </p>
