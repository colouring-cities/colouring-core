## Comments:
## Is dynamics_has_demolished_buildings = TRUE sufficient to prevent buildings being loaded? - No
## Lets mark them, then see if there even are any
##Â Describe these changes in PR and ask for comment if the bool is sufficient

## Prerequisites:
## - Make geometries table have coordinates (load_coordinates.sh) - DONE
## - <mastermap download>= release_geometries
  
# for geometry in geometries

  # if geometry.TOID not in builings
    # Add TOID to temp table called new_geometries

# psql -c "CREATE TABLE new_geometries (
#         geometry_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
#         source_id varchar(30)
# );"
psql -c "SELECT geometry_id, source_id
         FROM geometries
         WHERE source_id NOT IN ( SELECT ref_toid FROM buildings);"

# for building in buildings

  # if building.TOID not in new release_geometries
    # buildings.dynamics_has_demolished_buildings = TRUE
    
  # secondarily, if building.coordinates <10m away from any new_geometry.coordinates
    # older_building.dynamics_has_demolished_buildings = TRUE
    # link new_geometry TOID in the geometries table to old building and delete duplicate building we just created for new_geometry
